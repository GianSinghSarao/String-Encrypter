    <h1>String Encrypter</h1>
    <h2>A small single file program for encrypting strings of characters.</h2>
    <aside>
      Initially, The result of following an ancient tutorial (Hooray for backwards compatibility!) about HTML Applications, this experiment has grown more than I thought possible.

      <h3>Disclaimer:</h3>
      <p><i>String Encrypter</i>, Despite its Name, Is Not Secure. It Is Not To Be Used In Any Place Where Any Form Of Sensitive Data Is Being Transferred Or Stored. It Is Easy To Break And Can Be Broken Quickly Using A Simple Brute-Force Attack.</p>
    </aside>
    <h3>Usage:</h3>
    <p>Download the latest version of the program from <a href="https://github.com/GianSinghSarao/String-Encrypter/raw/master/dist/Encrypter.hta" target="_blank" download="StringEncrypter.hta">Here</a> or use a heavily modified hosted version which works in most browsers <a href="Hosted/" target="_blank">Here</a></p>
    <p>Open the file in the built-in program "mshta.exe". (Double clicking in Windows Explorer does this automatically)</p>
    <p>Type a string into the main textarea and a password into the password field.</p>

      <img src="assets/1.PNG" alt="An image showing a hello world and a password typed in.">
    </a>
    <p>Click encrypt or decrypt.</p>
    <a href="assets/2.PNG" title="https://giansinghsarao.github.io/String-Encrypter/assets/2.PNG">
      <img src="assets/2.PNG" alt="An image showing the encrypted output after clicking the encrypt button.">
    </a>
    <p>By the way, the password used in the example images was 12345678. So you can type in the output of the encryption (D9L0S0S0V0P7S9V0Y0S0K0) and the password to decrypt it for yourself.</p>

      <h3>Disclaimer:</h3>
      <p>Because the String Encrypter is an HTA, which is obsolete and has been deprecated by newer techniques, it might not work on newer versions of windows. But more importantly, because it is propietary, it will not work at all on non-windows operating systems.</p>
